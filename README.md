# Travel Agency website 

The main goal of this project was to practice my html and css skills, media queries and also to learn how to use git and github. The main things used to build the website, were:

- Flexbox concepts
- Google maps integration
- Media queries  
	- The website is completely responsive, adapting to mobile phones, tablets and desktop

I also have a website that I use as my **CV**,  with the purpose of showing all of my skills and projects developed by me so far.  [Camila's CV](https://camilatavaresg.github.io/Camilatavares-curriculum/)

A huge thanks to Isadora, who has been helping me a lot in this journey to become a front-end developer!
